# B&G Club: Future Founders Lab & Venture Creation Showcase

**Dates:** February 3rd & 4th, 2026
**Location:** Stem Lab 1
**Objective:** To demonstrate a scalable model for youth-led digital entrepreneurship by showcasing the industrial-grade skills taught in the Detroit Automation Academy curriculum, from AI-driven design to go-to-market strategy and future autonomous systems.

## The "Venture Lifecycle" Showcase

Guests, especially donors and partners, will be guided through four distinct zones that mirror a modern product development and business lifecycle. This format is designed to highlight the depth and career-relevance of the curriculum.

### Station 1: The R&D Lab (AI & Parametric Design)
*Curriculum Link: `phase2_guide.md`*

*   **Activity:** Guests will use text-to-3D AI tools to generate a custom keychain concept.
*   **Student Role: "Product Designer"**
    *   Students will guide guests through AI prompting, explaining how to refine ideas.
*   **Donor Talking Point:** Students will explain that while AI provides rapid ideation, their core training is in parametric CAD using Python, as detailed in the Phase 2 guide. This demonstrates they are learning fundamental engineering principles, not just using novelty tools.

### Station 2: The Digital Factory (Advanced Manufacturing)
*Curriculum Link: `phase2_guide.md`*

*   **Hardware:** Bambu Lab X1 Carbon (CoreXY), Epilog Fusion Maker (Laser).
*   **Activity:** The guest's AI-generated design is manufactured on-demand.
    *   **Standard Product:** 3D printed on the high-speed Bambu Lab X1.
    *   **Premium Option:** A pre-designed token is engraved on the Epilog laser cutter.
*   **Student Role: "Manufacturing Lead"**
    *   Students manage the production queue and explain the technology.
*   **Donor Talking Point:** Students will highlight the industry-grade equipment, explaining the difference between FDM and laser engraving and why the CoreXY printer's speed and material capability (as noted in `phase2_guide.md`) are vital for rapid prototyping.

### Station 3: Go-to-Market Hub (E-Commerce & Analytics)
*Curriculum Link: `program_info.py`*

*   **Activity:** Guests photograph their finished product and create a listing on a demo e-commerce platform.
*   **Key Feature: The "Founder's Dashboard"**
    *   A large monitor will display live metrics for the event: # of Designs Created, # of Units Produced, # of Products Listed, and Total Potential Revenue.
*   **Student Role: "Go-to-Market Specialist"**
    *   Students assist with product descriptions and explain the metrics on the dashboard.
*   **Donor Talking Point:** This station demonstrates that the program teaches business acumen, not just technical skills. It's a live simulation of market validation, unit economics, and business analytics. [3, 4]

### Station 4: The Horizon (Autonomous Systems Showcase)
*Curriculum Link: `phase3_guide.md`, `phase3/autonomous_rover.py`*

*   **Activity:** A large screen will feature a continuous simulation of the `autonomous_rover.py` script navigating its environment.
*   **Student Role: "Systems Engineer"**
    *   A student will be stationed here to explain the simulation, using terms from the Phase 3 guide like "obstacle avoidance" and "pathfinding."
*   **Donor Talking Point:** This station is crucial for impressing supporters. It connects the simple act of making a keychain to a much larger vision. The message is: "The skills learned in Phases 1 and 2 are the foundation for the advanced autonomous systems we build in Phase 3. We are creating a pipeline of talent for the future of mobility." [16]

## The Business Model: From Prototype to Profit

This activation introduces core business principles in a tangible way that resonates with an investment-minded audience.

*   **Unit Economics:** Guests can purchase their creation for a nominal fee (e.g., $5). This is framed as covering the "Cost of Goods Sold" (COGS), teaching students a fundamental business concept.
*   **Market Validation:** The "Founder's Dashboard" tracks which designs are most popular, simulating live market research that could inform a larger production run.
*   **Social Enterprise Potential:** The entire workflow is presented as a pilot for a student-run business, a scalable social enterprise that could generate its own revenue stream.

## Donor Engagement

*   **One-Page Handout:** Prepare a professional one-page document for donors. It should summarize the academy's mission (from `program_info.py`), outline the three curriculum phases, and highlight key outcomes like the FAA Part 107 prep.
*   **"Shark Tank" Pitch:** During the Tuesday workshops, have a student team give a 3-minute "pitch" for their keychain "business" to a panel of visiting donors, mirroring popular investment shows. [5, 20]
