## The "Founder" Workflow
Instead of separate zones, guests will follow a three-step workflow to experience the full journey from concept to market.

### Step 1: The AI Design Studio (Concept to CAD)
*Best for: Creativity, learning about AI in design.*
*   **Hardware:** Laptops or tablets.
*   **Activity:** **"Prompt Your Product"**
    *   Guests will use text-to-3D AI tools to design a unique, custom keychain. They will be guided on how to write effective prompts to generate interesting and printable models.
    *   **AI Tools:** We can use Bambu Lab's integrated **PrintMon Maker** for character-style designs, or web-based tools like **Meshy.ai** for more varied styles. [2, 8]
    *   **Output:** The activity generates a 3D-printable STL file.
*   **Student Role: "AI Design Consultant"**
    *   Students will help guests brainstorm ideas and translate them into descriptive text prompts for the AI. They will explain how specificity in language can alter the final 3D model.

### Step 2: The Micro-Factory (CAD to Product)
*Best for: Understanding modern manufacturing.*
*   **Hardware:** Bambu Lab A1 and X1 Carbon 3D printers connected to a central staff computer.
*   **Activity:** **"On-Demand Manufacturing"**
    *   The guest's unique STL file is sent to the central computer, where it is "sliced" into machine instructions (G-code).
    *   The design is then printed live on one of the high-speed Bambu Lab printers.
*   **Student Role: "Production Operator"**
    *   Students manage the print queue, explain the slicing process, and oversee the physical production of the keychains, ensuring quality control.

### Step 3: The E-Commerce Launchpad (Product to Market)
*Best for: Introduction to business and marketing.*
*   **Hardware:** A laptop with a pre-built demo e-commerce storefront (e.g., Shopify or Etsy) and a small lightbox for product photography.
*   **Activity:** **"Launch Your Store"**
    *   Once the keychain is printed, guests take a quality photo of their product.
    *   They then create a product listing on the demo storefront, writing a short description and setting a price.
    *   **Outcome:** Guests receive a shareable link to their product page, simulating their first entry into e-commerce.
*   **Student Role: "E-commerce Strategist"**
    *   Students guide guests on how to present their product, write compelling descriptions, and think about pricing.

## Schedule & Content Strategy

### Monday, Feb 3rd (60-Minute Slots)
*Context: High traffic, focus on a quick, engaging experience.*
*   **4:00 PM – 7:00 PM:** **"Fast-Track Founder" Mode.**
    *   Guests can choose from a curated list of pre-generated AI designs to have printed immediately.
    *   Students focus on the "Micro-Factory" and "E-Commerce Launchpad" steps, quickly getting products listed online.

### Tuesday, Feb 4th (90-Minute Slots)
*Context: Deeper engagement with school groups.*
*   **9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 4:30 PM:** **"Full-Stack Founder" Workshops.**
    *   Students lead small groups through the entire 3-step workflow, from writing an AI prompt to publishing their product page.
    *   **Challenge:** A "Best Product Page" competition where the most creative listing wins a small prize.

## The Business Model: Your First Sale

This activation introduces core business principles in a tangible way.

*   **Product Creation:** Guests design and create their own product, giving them immediate ownership.
*   **Pricing Strategy:**
    *   **Cost of Goods:** Guests can purchase their own creation for a nominal fee (e.g., $5) to cover material and operational costs.
    *   **Market Price:** When listing on the e-commerce site, students will help them think about a fair market price.
*   **Sales & Revenue:** We can simulate sales by allowing other guests or parents to "buy" the products from the demo store. This can be tracked on a leaderboard to show which designs are popular.

## Resource & Staffing Distribution

*   **Total Students Needed:** 4-6 per shift.
*   **AI Design Studio:** 2 Students (Assisting with prompts and idea generation).
*   **Micro-Factory:** 2 Students (Managing the central slicing computer and printers).
*   **E-Commerce Launchpad:** 2 Students (Helping with photography and product listings).
