## 🎯 CONCEPT OVERVIEW

### Strategic Direction

**Concept Name:** Connected Detroit  
**Core Idea:** Abstract Detroit skyline transformed into a circuit board or network map. Celebrating Detroit community while representing technology/connections. Geometric, modern, locally-specific.

**Why This Concept:**
- Uniquely Detroit (not generic tech organization)
- Combines community + technology beautifully
- Modern geometric execution
- Tells a story visually
- Memorable and distinctive (different from every other tech nonprofit)

**Target Message:**
- Primary: Technology serving Detroit community
- Secondary: Local connections, networking, collaboration
- Tertiary: Growth and forward momentum

**Visual Elements:**
- Abstracted Detroit skyline (iconic buildings)
- Circuit board patterns or network nodes
- Connecting lines (suggesting pathways/networking)
- Color reflects Detroit pride + tech future

**Brand Pillar Alignment:**
- ✅ **Community:** Celebrates Detroit specifically (not generic)
- ✅ **Innovation:** Modern geometric execution, forward-thinking
- ✅ **Accessibility:** Clear narrative (city → tech connection), inclusive
- ✅ **Practicality:** Professional appearance, memorable for partnerships

## 🔍 CURRENT TEMPLATE ASSESSMENT

**Current File:** `/branding/concepts/03-Detroit-Circuit/logo-template.svg`

**Current Status:** Strategic template exists but needs substantial work

**What's Strong:**
- ✅ Concept direction is compelling (Detroit + circuit is powerful)
- ✅ Unique positioning (no other nonprofits use this approach)
- ✅ Memorable visual metaphor
- ✅ Clear narrative ("Detroit connected to technology")

**What Needs Substantial Work:**
- ❌ Detroit skyline detail needs research (which buildings iconic?)
- ❌ Skyline abstraction level unclear (how geometric vs. recognizable?)
- ❌ Circuit integration not fully resolved (how do lines interact with skyline?)
- ❌ Geometry is imprecise (hand-drawn, inconsistent)
- ❌ No variations created (color, mono, inverted untested)
- ❌ Scale testing not done (clarity at small/large sizes uncertain)
- ❌ Context mockups not created (real-world application unproven)

**Improvement Strategy:** Option B - CREATE NEW (or Option C - HYBRID)
- Research Detroit iconic architecture (identify key buildings/skyline elements)
- Decide: geometric abstraction level (low-poly? line-based? semi-realistic?)
- Design fresh skyline using modern geometric approach
- Integrate circuit/network lines meaningfully
- Create all variations and test thoroughly
- May use current template as inspiration, but rebuild from ground up

## 📐 DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

### Color Palette (Option A - Tech Forward)
**Use EXACTLY these hex codes:**

- **Primary Brand Color:** Electric Blue
  - HEX: #0066CC
  - RGB: 0, 102, 204
  - Pantone: 300 C
  - **Primary use:** Detroit skyline/main element

- **Secondary Color (Accent):** Rust / Detroit Burn
  - HEX: #CC5522
  - RGB: 204, 85, 34
  - Pantone: 1535 C
  - **Use:** Accent lines, circuit pathways (represents Detroit industrial heritage)

- **Supporting Color:** Lime / Forward Motion
  - HEX: #66CC00
  - RGB: 102, 204, 0
  - Pantone: 375 C
  - **Use:** Growth indicators, connecting nodes (optional accent)

- **Neutrals:**
  - Black: #111111
  - Medium Gray: #666666
  - Light Gray: #F5F5F5

**Accessibility Verified:**
- Blue + white: 8.6:1 contrast ✅ (AA+)
- Blue + black: 8.3:1 contrast ✅ (AA+)
- Rust + white: 4.8:1 contrast ✅ (AA+)

### Geometric Style

**Recommended Approach:** Low-Poly or Geometric Abstraction
- Similar to trendy "low-poly" city illustrations (modern aesthetic)
- Use clean angular lines instead of curves for skyline
- Simplify Detroit skyline to 5-8 iconic building silhouettes
- Triangular or angular geometry (suggests precision, tech)
- Scalable without losing detail (works at any size)

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Line-based (minimal, elegant, circuits as connecting lines)
- Semi-geometric (realistic building shapes + circuit overlays)
- Pure circuit abstraction (skyline outline formed by circuit paths)

**Your choice:** Pick the approach that feels right for brand positioning

### Stroke & Line Specifications

**Primary Strokes (Skyline outline):**
- Width: 2-3px (specify intentionally)
- Style: Angular/geometric (suggests precision)
- Consistency: All primary strokes EXACTLY same width

**Circuit/Secondary Lines:**
- Width: 1-1.5px (thinner than skyline for hierarchy)
- Style: Organic curves (suggests connections, technology)
- Consistency: All secondary strokes EXACTLY same width
- Connect: Network nodes or skyline points

**Color Application:**
- Skyline: Primary blue (#0066CC)
- Circuit lines: Secondary rust (#CC5522) or accent lime (#66CC00)
- Background: White or transparent
