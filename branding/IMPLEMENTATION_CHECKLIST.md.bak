## 🔄 DEPENDENCIES & BLOCKERS

### Critical Path Items

1. **@CTO Design Tool Selection** (impacts all design work)
   - Decision needed: Adobe? Figma? Inkscape?
   - Impact: Determines file formats and workflows
   - Target: Feb 1 AM (before design work begins)

2. **Budget Approval** (may impact tool/contractor decisions)
   - Decision needed: $500, $1,500, or $2,500 range?
   - Impact: Design contractor availability, premium tool access
   - Target: Feb 1 (before kickoff)

3. **Logo Concept Selection** (shapes Phase 2 direction)
   - Decision needed: Which 1-2 concepts to develop?
   - Impact: Design effort and stakeholder presentation
   - Target: Feb 1 (after kickoff discussion)

### Potential Blockers

- ⚠️ If @CTO lacks design software access
- ⚠️ If team cannot meet for kickoff (Feb 1)
- ⚠️ If stakeholder feedback delays concept selection
- ⚠️ If budget not approved by Feb 1 PM

**Mitigation:** Have backup plans for each blocker documented by Jan 31 EOD
