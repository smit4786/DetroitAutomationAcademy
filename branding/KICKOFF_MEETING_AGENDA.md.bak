---

## ⏱️ AGENDA (30 Minutes)

### 1. WELCOME & CONTEXT (2 min)
**Lead:** @Admin

**Message:**
- ✅ Phase 1 strategy & concepts complete (Jan 31)
- ✅ Production quality framework established
- 🔄 NOW: Execute high-fidelity designs Feb 1-3
- 📅 GOAL: Feb 3, 12:00 PM submission → Feb 3, 2:00 PM stakeholder presentation
- **Tone:** Excitement about launch, confidence in timeline

**Quick Recap:**
- Brand strategy: "Automation skills for Detroit's future, built by Detroiters"
- Quality standard: 5 aesthetic standards, 16-point checklist (not aspirational—technical)
- Approach: 1-2 concepts at production quality (not 5 at prototype level)

---

### 2. CONFIRM DECISIONS (5 min)
**Lead:** @Admin | **Required Input:** @CTO, @COO, @SCHEDULER

**Decision 1: Which 1-2 Concepts to Focus On?**

**Recommendation:** Concepts 1 (Gear + Circuit) + 3 (Detroit Circuit)

**Rationale:**
- Concept 1: Strongest for "tech credibility" + modern aesthetic
- Concept 3: Strongest for "Detroit pride" + uniqueness
- Together: Cover full brand value proposition
- Resources: 2 concepts = 24-40 hours achievable in 48-hour sprint

**Confirm:**
- [ ] @CTO: Agrees with Concepts 1 & 3?
- [ ] @CTO: Ready to execute both at production quality?
- [ ] @COO: Resources confirmed for 2-concept approach?

**If overriding:**
- [ ] @CTO: Which 1-2 concepts instead?
- [ ] @CTO: Why this choice?
- [ ] @CTO: Timeline impact?

**Decision:** _________________ (locked after kickoff)

---

**Decision 2: Improvement Strategy per Concept?**

**Concept 1 (Gear + Circuit)**  
**Recommendation:** Option A - IMPROVE EXISTING

**Rationale:**
- Current template direction is solid (clean geometric approach)
- Template has right balance of complexity vs. clarity
- Primary need: precision, consistency, variations (not complete rebuild)
- Estimated effort: 12-16 hours (feasible)

**Confirm:**
- [ ] @CTO: Agrees with improve (Option A)?
- [ ] @CTO: Or prefer create new (Option B)?
- [ ] @CTO: Or prefer hybrid (Option C)?

---

**Concept 3 (Detroit Circuit)**  
**Recommendation:** Option B - CREATE NEW (or Option C - HYBRID)

**Rationale:**
- Current template needs significant research (Detroit skyline, circuit integration)
- Better to build fresh with clear architecture than patch existing
- Opportunity to explore skyline integration thoroughly
- Estimated effort: 12-16 hours (feasible)

**Confirm:**
- [ ] @CTO: Agrees with create new (Option B)?
- [ ] @CTO: Or prefer improve existing (Option A)?
- [ ] @CTO: Or prefer hybrid (Option C)?

---

**Decision:** 
- Concept 1: __________ (A/B/C)
- Concept 3: __________ (A/B/C)

(Locked after kickoff)

---

**Decision 3: Resource Blockers?**

**Confirm:**
- [ ] @CTO: Design tool access ready? (Adobe Illustrator or Figma?)
- [ ] @CTO: Color palette accessible? (Reference file imported?)
- [ ] @CTO: Typography locked? (Poppins + Inter loaded?)
- [ ] @CTO: Can dedicate full effort Feb 1-3 without interruptions?
- [ ] @COO: Budget confirmed for any contractor needs?
- [ ] @COO: Adobe licenses available if needed?
- [ ] @SCHEDULER: Team calendar blocked (no conflicting meetings)?
- [ ] All: Any other blockers to escalate?

**Blockers:** _________________ (escalate immediately if any)
