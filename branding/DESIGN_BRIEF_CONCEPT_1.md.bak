# 🎨 DESIGN BRIEF: CONCEPT 1 - GEAR + CIRCUIT

**TO:** @CTO (Design Lead)  
**FROM:** @Admin (Project Coordination)  
**DATE:** January 31, 2026  
**PRIORITY:** 🔴 HIGH - Design Sprint Kickoff Feb 1, 9:00 AM  
**DEADLINE:** Feb 3, 2026 @ 12:00 PM EST (firm)

---

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Begin high-fidelity refinement of **Concept 1: Gear + Circuit** (Tech Precision United) for production quality presentation to stakeholders Feb 3.

**Current Status:** Strategic template exists (rough geometry, hand-drawn imprecision)  
**Goal:** Transform into production-ready design (precision geometry, consistent strokes, verified at all scales)  
**Recommended Approach:** Option A - IMPROVE EXISTING (refine template, don't rebuild)  
**Timeline:** Feb 1-3 (48-hour sprint)  
**Expected Effort:** 12-16 hours focused work  
**Deliverables:** 11 items including color + mono + inverted vectors + 4 context mockups

---

## 🎯 CONCEPT OVERVIEW

### Strategic Direction

**Concept Name:** Tech Precision United  
**Core Idea:** A stylized gear with integrated circuit pathways, suggesting precision automation + technological advancement. Clean, modern, geometric.

**Why This Concept:**
- Immediately communicates "automation" through gear imagery
- Modern geometric approach avoids clichéd gear designs
- Scalable and clear at small sizes (business card) and large sizes (banner)
- Works in monochrome and color
- Professional and technical while remaining accessible

**Target Message:**
- Primary: Precision, automation, technology, innovation
- Secondary: Professional credibility, modern aesthetic
- Tertiary: Detroit industrial heritage (if rust color incorporated)

**Visual Elements:**
- Central hexagonal or circular gear
- Circuit lines flowing from gear points
- Asymmetrical balance (suggests motion, not static)
- 2-3 colors: primary tech color + accent

**Brand Pillar Alignment:**
- ✅ **Innovation:** Cutting-edge aesthetic, modern geometric approach
- ✅ **Practicality:** Professional appearance, technical credibility for grants/partnerships
- ✅ **Accessibility:** Clean lines, clear at all scales, works for diverse audiences
- ✅ **Community:** Subtle Detroit industrial references through warm accent color

---

## 🔍 CURRENT TEMPLATE ASSESSMENT

**Current File:** `/branding/concepts/01-Gear-Circuit/logo-template.svg`

**What's Good:**
- ✅ Concept direction is sound (gear + circuit approach is solid)
- ✅ Overall composition is balanced
- ✅ Core idea is distinctive and memorable
- ✅ Scales reasonably well

**What Needs Improvement:**
- ❌ Geometry is hand-drawn and imprecise (curves wobble, angles inconsistent)
- ❌ Stroke weights vary unintentionally (2.5px, 2px, etc. - not intentional)
- ❌ No variations created (only single template, needs color + mono + inverted)
- ❌ Colors not verified against palette spec (needs exact hex codes)
- ❌ Monochrome version never tested (hierarchy may be unclear without color)
- ❌ Inverted version never tested (contrast on dark backgrounds unverified)
- ❌ Scale testing not documented (unclear if really works at 0.5" and 24")
- ❌ Context mockups not created (real-world viability unproven)

**Improvement Strategy:** Option A - IMPROVE EXISTING
- Start with current template direction
- Rebuild geometry with precision (smooth curves, exact angles)
- Add intentional, consistent strokes
- Create all variations (color, mono, inverted)
- Test at all 5 scales
- Create 4 context mockups
- No brand direction change—just technical polish

- Kerning: Tight, modern, geometric feel
- Reference: `TYPOGRAPHY_SYSTEM.md`

### Stroke Specifications

**Primary Strokes (Gear outline, main elements):**

- Alignment: Center or inside (specify intentionally)
- Consistency: All primary strokes EXACTLY same width—no variance

**Secondary Strokes (Circuit lines, supporting elements):**
- Width: 1.5px (or as intentionally specified)
- Consistency: All secondary strokes EXACTLY same width
- Any variation must be intentional and explained

**Stroke Style:**
- Caps: Round (for modern, friendly feel)

### Geometric Standards

**Precision Requirements:**
- All curves: Smooth, no wobbles at 300% zoom
- All angles: Exact (45°, 90°, 60°, etc. where applicable)
- Symmetry: Where intended, must be mathematically perfect
- Asymmetry: Where intended, must be deliberate (not accidental)

**Tool Specifics (Adobe Illustrator):**
- Use bezier curves with smooth point transitions
- Avoid auto-trace or hand-drawn tools
- Verify all paths are clean (no extra anchor points)
- Convert strokes to paths only if necessary for final export

**Tool Specifics (Figma):**
- Use vector paths with intentional curvature
- Verify all anchor points are optimized
- Export as SVG with clean code
- Test SVG in multiple browsers for curve rendering
