**Visual Style:**
- Flat design (modern, scalable, accessible)
- Subtle depth/shadows for dimensionality
- White space (breathing room, clarity)
- Bold typography (confidence, clarity)
- Accent color for emphasis

**Imagery Approach:**

## 📐 KEY VISUAL METAPHORS

These concepts will guide all design work:

### Metaphor 1: THE GEAR
- **Meaning:** Precision, automation, industrial, working together
- **Usage:** Logo element, icon system, pattern backgrounds
- **Caution:** Avoid clichéd gear imagery (too generic)
- **Execution:** Stylized, modern gear that feels fresh

### Metaphor 2: THE LEARNING CYCLE
- **Meaning:** Continuous improvement, phases of learning, progression
- **Usage:** Phase 1/2/3 visual markers, educational journey
- **Caution:** Don't make it look like a pie chart
- **Execution:** Circular progress with modern aesthetic

### Metaphor 3: DETROIT SKYLINE
- **Meaning:** Community, place, pride, growth
- **Usage:** Secondary mark, website header, accent imagery
- **Caution:** Use abstracted/stylized version (not photorealistic)
- **Execution:** Low-poly or geometric skyline line

### Metaphor 4: CIRCUIT/CONNECTION
- **Meaning:** Technology, neural networks, collaboration, pathways
- **Usage:** Pattern backgrounds, icon connections, network imagery
- **Caution:** Don't make it too technical (should still feel human)
- **Execution:** Organic curves suggesting circuits/connections

### Metaphor 5: HANDS/BUILDING
- **Meaning:** Practical skills, hands-on learning, construction, human-centered
- **Usage:** Accent illustrations, instructional imagery, values representation
- **Caution:** Use thoughtfully (avoid being too literal/cheesy)
- **Execution:** Minimalist hand outlines or silhouettes

## 🎯 LOGO DESIGN DIRECTION

### What the Logo Should Communicate

**In a single glance:**

2. Education (secondary)
3. Detroit community (context)
4. Modern/Forward-thinking (feeling)

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ Works at 1" (business card) and 10" (banner)
- ✅ Effective in full color and monochrome
- ✅ Distinctive and memorable

### Concept Direction

**Desired Characteristics:**

- 2-3 primary elements (not cluttered)
- Professional (not playful/childish)
- Memorable (distinctive mark)
- Versatile (works in many contexts)
- Detroit identity (subtle or explicit)

**What to Avoid:**

## 🎨 COLOR PALETTE STRATEGY

### Primary Palette (To Be Defined)

**Tier 1: Primary Brand Color (1-2 colors)**
- Main color for logo, headings, key elements
- Must have good contrast with white and black
- Should evoke technology + innovation

**Tier 2: Secondary Colors (2-3 colors)**
- Supporting colors for hierarchy
- One "Detroit Pride" color (warm)
- One "Growth/Energy" color (bright)
- Neutral supporting color (gray)

**Tier 3: Neutrals (1-2 colors)**
- Black/very dark gray (#111111 or similar)
- White/off-white (#FFFFFF or #F5F5F5)
- Medium gray for lighter backgrounds

### Accessibility Requirements

**WCAG AA Compliance:**
- ✅ All color pairs minimum 4.5:1 contrast for text
- ✅ 3:1 contrast minimum for graphics/UI elements
- ✅ Not reliant on color alone for information (use patterns/texture too)
- ✅ Test all combinations for colorblind accessibility
