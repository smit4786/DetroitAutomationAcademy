## Design Specifications

### Colors
- Primary: #0066CC (Electric Blue)
- Secondary: #CC5522 (Rust)
- Accent: #66CC00 (Lime)

### Size Variations (Test At)
- [ ] 0.5" (business card size)
- [ ] 1" (standard web icon)
- [ ] 2" (website logo)
- [ ] 6" (large display)
- [ ] 24" (banner/poster)

### Variations Needed
- [ ] Full color (primary + secondary + accent)
- [ ] Monochrome (black only)
- [ ] Inverted (white on dark)
- [ ] On colored background (test contrast)

### Context Mockups
- [ ] Website header (960px × 120px)
- [ ] Business card (2" × 3.5")
- [ ] Social media profile (1200px × 630px)
- [ ] Event poster (36" × 24")

## Refinement Notes

### What Works
- Geometric gear shape is clear and scalable
- Circuit pathway adds technology element
- Color palette provides good contrast

### Areas to Explore
- Simplify gear teeth for small sizes
- Consider circuit node shapes (squares vs circles)
- Test line weights at different scales
- Explore alternative circuit patterns

### Design Direction
- Keep lines clean and modern
- Maintain geometric precision
- Ensure scalability without detail loss
- Test in monochrome first for clarity
