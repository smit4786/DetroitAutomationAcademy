# 🎨 LOGO CONCEPT FRAMEWORK - Detroit Automation Academy

**Document Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Status:** Phase 1 - Concept Development (Refined for Production Quality)  
**Owner:** @CTO  
**Deadline:** Feb 3, 2026 (1-2 concepts at PRODUCTION-READY quality)

---

## 🎯 PROJECT BRIEF

Create production-quality logo concepts that communicate:
1. **Automation/Technology** (primary)
2. **Education** (secondary)
3. **Detroit Community** (context)
4. **Innovation & Forward Motion**

**Critical Constraints:**
- Must work at multiple scales (0.5" - 24")
- Must be effective in color AND monochrome
- Must be professional (suitable for grants/corporate partnerships)
- Must be memorable and distinctive
- Must be timeless (won't look dated in 5 years)
- **NEW:** Must meet Production Design Standards (see `PRODUCTION_DESIGN_STANDARDS.md`)

**Strategic Shift for Phase 1:**
- Focus on **1-2 concepts at high-fidelity** (not all 5 at template level)
- Quality over quantity—each concept must include all required deliverables
- All concepts must include context mockups, scale testing, and monochrome verification
- Concepts must be ready for external stakeholder presentation (grant reviewers, corporate partners)

---

## 🎨 PRODUCTION DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

**Every concept must deliver:**

### Aesthetic Quality Standards
1. **Geometric Precision** - All curves smooth, angles exact, no hand-drawn imprecision
2. **Stroke Consistency** - All strokes intentional and uniform (2-3px primary, 1.5px secondary)
3. **Color Fidelity** - Exact hex codes from palette, WCAG AA contrast verified
4. **Scalability Tested** - Verified clear at 0.5", 1", 2", 6", 24" with no detail loss
5. **Visual Hierarchy** - Single focal point with clear primary/secondary/tertiary elements

### Mandatory Deliverables (Per Concept)
- [ ] Full color vector (.SVG, layered)
- [ ] Monochrome version (proves works without color)
- [ ] Inverted version (white on dark background)
- [ ] Scale verification image (all 5 sizes side-by-side)
- [ ] 4 Context mockups: website header, business card, social media, event poster
- [ ] Design rationale document (2-3 paragraphs + reference to pillars)

### Quality Gate Before Stakeholder Presentation
Must pass `PRODUCTION_DESIGN_STANDARDS.md` Design Review Checklist:
- ✅ Precision verification (no geometry errors)
- ✅ Consistency review (colors, strokes, spacing)
- ✅ Scalability testing (all 5 sizes verified)
- ✅ Accessibility review (contrast, colorblind, monochrome)
- ✅ Brand alignment (pillars supported, distinctive, professional)

**Reference:** See `PRODUCTION_DESIGN_STANDARDS.md` for complete standards documentation, examples of production vs. immature design, and quality checklist.
