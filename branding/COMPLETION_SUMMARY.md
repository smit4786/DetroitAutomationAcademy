## 🎯 Key Changes at a Glance

### What Changed
❌ → ✅ From templates to production-quality requirement  
❌ → ✅ From 5 concepts equally developed to 1-2 at high fidelity  
❌ → ✅ From light refinement to complete rebuild  
❌ → ✅ From no quality gate to 16-point approval checklist  

### What Didn't Change
✅ February 1-3 timeline remains the same  
✅ Brand strategy and pillars unchanged  
✅ Color palette and typography unchanged  
✅ 5 concept directions still available (1-2 for production, 3 as backups)  

### New Expectations
✅ Every concept must include: color + monochrome + inverted + 4 mockups + scale testing  
✅ All concepts must pass 16-point Design Review Checklist  
✅ Geometric precision required (smooth curves, exact angles, no hand-drawn feel)  
✅ Stroke consistency required (intentional line weights, no variance)  
✅ Scalability verified (tested at 0.5", 1", 2", 6", 24")  
✅ Accessibility verified (WCAG AA contrast, colorblind-safe, monochrome works)
