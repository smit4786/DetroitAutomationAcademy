# DetroitAutomationAcademy

The Opportunity:

Detroit is the global epicenter of mobility innovation, yet a significant disconnect remains
between the advanced technologies being developed at Michigan Central and the educational
opportunities available to Detroit’s youth. While software jobs are booming, few programs exist
that bridge the gap between code and physical application. To ensure the next generation of
Detroiters can build, maintain, and innovate within the autonomous sector, we must move
beyond screen-based coding to "Physical Computing.
"
The Solution
Automated Technologies proposes The Detroit Automation Academy, a 24-week immersive
workforce development fellowship hosted at the Youth STEM Lab. Unlike traditional bootcamps,
our curriculum is rooted in industrial application. We teach high school students (Grades 9-12)
how to write Python code that controls the physical world—from autonomous rovers to aerial
drones.
By leveraging Michigan Central’s state-of-the-art makerspace, we transform abstract concepts
into tangible skills. Students don't just learn syntax; they 3D print rover chassis, laser-cut sensor
mounts, and write the algorithms that allow these machines to navigate the world autonomously.
Program Overview
• Structure: Two 12-week cohorts (Spring & Fall 2026).
• Capacity: 50 Students total (25 per cohort).
• Target Audience: Detroit residents (Districts 1-5), with a goal of 50% female participation.
• Curriculum:
• Phase 1: Python Fundamentals & Microcontrollers (Raspberry Pi).
• Phase 2: CAD Design & Rapid Prototyping (3D Printing/Laser Cutting).
• Phase 3: Autonomous Systems & Sensor Fusion (Capstone Projects).
Key Outcomes
1. Industrial Fluency: Students gain intermediate proficiency in Python and Linux environments,
the standard toolset for modern robotics.
2. Certification: Graduates earn the Automated Technologies Junior Technologist Certificate and
complete FAA Part 107 (Drone Pilot) prep work.
3. Career Pathways: Direct mentorship from industry practitioners and exposure to the Newlab
ecosystem, demystifying careers in advanced manufacturing and mobility.
