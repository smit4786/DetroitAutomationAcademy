## 🔐 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review Git history for this email exposure duration
   - Consider force-pushing to remove from commit history if sensitive
   - Monitor leadership@detroitautomationacademy.org for suspicious activity

2. **Process Changes:**
   - Use role-based references instead of explicit group emails (e.g., "authorized leadership team")
   - Add `.env` or `.secrets` file with email configurations (excluded from repo)
   - Update `.gitignore` to prevent email list commits

3. **Documentation:**
   - Replace hardcoded emails with environment variables
   - Use placeholders like `[LEADERSHIP_EMAIL]` in shareable docs
   - Store actual email list in secure, non-versioned config
