## 🤖 Agent Perspectives & Feedback

### 1️⃣ **Chief Technology Officer** (CTO)
**Role Focus:** Technical implementation, system architecture, technology alignment

**CTO Feedback on Enrollment Template:**
- ✅ **Data Structure:** Form fields map well to database schema (name, email, phone, program, experience level)
- ✅ **Accessibility:** Emoji headers and clear hierarchy improve screen reader navigation
- ⚠️ **Integration Points:**
  - Suggest adding "Preferred Contact Method" field (Email/Phone/Text) for automation routing
  - Consider adding GitHub username field (if they want to participate in open-source projects)
  - Could benefit from "Technical Skill Tags" optional field for better matching with courses
- 💡 **Suggestion:** Add technical proficiency self-assessment (Python? CAD? Soldering?) to route to appropriate skill level

**Recommendation:** Add optional "Technical Background" checkbox section
```markdown
### Technical Background (Optional - Helps us customize your experience)
- [ ] Python programming
- [ ] CAD/3D design
- [ ] Soldering/Electronics
- [ ] Mechanical design
- [ ] None - I'm starting from scratch
```

### 2️⃣ **Chief Operating Officer** (COO)
**Role Focus:** Operations, workflows, efficiency, timelines, resource management

**COO Feedback on Enrollment Template:**
- ✅ **Workflow:** Current form creates trackable issues for enrollment pipeline
- ✅ **Time-to-Complete:** 2-3 min estimate is realistic and sets expectations
- ⚠️ **Operational Concerns:**
  - Form routing unclear - how do we prioritize by age/program interest?
  - Missing "Available Start Date" field (operational planning)
  - No field for "Referred By" (critical for tracking event success metrics)
  - Missing "Commitment Level" (affects cohort planning)
- 💡 **Suggestion:** Add fields for operational tracking and planning

**Recommendation:** Add operational routing & planning fields
```markdown
