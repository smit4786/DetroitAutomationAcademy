Daily Brief — 2026-02-07

Update: BGC_EVENT_STATUS_DASHBOARD.html updated (commit c6152c8) — added partnership acknowledgement with Boys and Girls Club of Greater Detroit & Michigan Central, acknowledged 5 anonymized participant signups, added Daily News tile, and enhanced tile-based styling.

Privacy & Security Validation: PASS
- Participants displayed as anonymized labels ("Participant #1" through "Participant #5").
- Reviewed BGC_EVENT_STATUS_DASHBOARD.html: no email addresses, mailto links, or phone numbers found; admin tile remains restricted with no credentials or direct admin links exposed.
- No PII introduced by these changes.

Deployment: GitHub Pages 'pages build and deployment' workflow completed successfully for commit c6152c8, but live site still shows previous content (likely CDN/GitHub Pages cache propagation delay). Recommended actions: purge CDN cache or perform a cache-busting redeploy and re-verify.

Next steps: Monitor live site for updated content, confirm cache purge if needed, and re-run privacy check after changes are visible.
