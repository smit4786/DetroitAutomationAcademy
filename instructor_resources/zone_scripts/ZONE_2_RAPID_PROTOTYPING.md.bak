## ⚠️ PRE-DEMO SAFETY BRIEFING (Required for Every Guest Group)

**[Gather group at a safe distance from laser cutter, BEFORE opening protective enclosure]**

**"Okay, we're about to fire up the laser cutter. This is cool, but we need to follow some safety rules:**

**1. NO ONE gets closer than 3 feet from the machine while it's running**
**2. Don't put your hands in the cutting bed**
**3. Don't look directly at the laser beam**
**4. If the fire alarm goes off, we evacuate immediately**
**5. There's a fire extinguisher right here [point] in case of emergency**

**Everyone understand? Great. Let's do this."**

## 🎯 OPENING SCRIPT (60 seconds)

**[Gesture to laser cutter]**

**"Welcome to the 'Rapid Prototyping' station. This is a laser cutter—basically a robot with a laser beam for a finger. In about 30 seconds, it's going to cut your commemorative token from acrylic.**

**Here's what makes this cool: In Zone 1, someone designed this token using Python code. We converted that code into instructions for the laser cutter. Now the laser is about to bring that digital design into the real world. That's called 'rapid prototyping'—from idea to physical product in minutes, not weeks."**

---

## 📋 DEMO WALKTHROUGH (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Show The Design (90 seconds)
**[Point to laptop screen connected to laser cutter]**

**"This screen shows what the laser cutter 'sees.' It's called G-code—basically coordinates that tell the laser 'cut here, cut here, cut here.' The file came from the Python script we showed you in Zone 1.**

**See this design? [Point to token outline on screen] This is your token. It says 'Detroit Automation Academy' on one side and today's date on the other. When the laser runs, it's going to trace this exact path with a high-powered beam."**

**[Show multiple designs if available]**

**"We've got a few designs today: gear tokens, squares, circles, and triangles. The laser can cut any shape we program it to cut."**

### Step 2: Material & Safety Verification (60 seconds)
**[Point to acrylic blank in cutting bed]**

**"The material we're cutting is acrylic—it's like plastic, but stronger. We cut it because:**
- **It's safe** (doesn't release toxic fumes like some materials)
- **It's durable** (your token won't break easily)
- **It looks nice** (the laser edge is smooth and clean)

**Before we cut, we always check a few things:**
- **Is the laser focused?** [Point to focal length—should be visible on machine]
- **Is the ventilation fan running?** [Point to vent—should be audible]
- **Is the safety enclosure door closed?** [Demonstrate closing]

**If anything is off, we don't run the laser. Safety first, always."**

### Step 3: Fire Up The Laser! (30 seconds setup)
**[Hands on controls, but narrate everything]**

**"Alright, we're ready. First, I'm going to move the laser to the starting position..."**

**[Press 'Home' or equivalent button]**

**"Next, I'm going to load the G-code file for the token..."**

**[Select file on screen]**

**"And now... here we go!"**

**[Press 'Run' or 'Cut' button]**

### Step 4: Watch The Magic (20-40 seconds)
**[Let laser run while narrating]**

**"There it goes! See the laser tracing the design? That's a CO2 laser—5,000 degrees Celsius, focused into a beam the width of a human hair. The laser vaporizes the acrylic as it cuts.**

**Notice the smell? That's the acrylic burning slightly—totally normal. That's why the ventilation fan is running.**

**See how fast it is? This entire token took about 30 seconds. In a traditional factory, this would take hours of manual work. That's why they call it 'rapid prototyping'—it's fast."**

**[If laser finishes early, continue:]**

**"And... done! The laser just finished cutting your token. It's still hot, so we're going to let it cool for about 30 seconds before removing it."**

### Step 5: Remove & Present Token (60 seconds)
**[Wait for cooling, then carefully remove token from bed using tongs or heat-resistant gloves]**

**"Alright, let me grab that..."**

**[Remove token carefully]**

**"Here's your token! Feel the edge—it's smooth, right? That's the laser doing precise work. No rough edges like you'd get with traditional cutting tools.**

**This token is uniquely yours because you watched it get created. You can keep it as proof that you participated in the Detroit Automation Academy. It's also a reminder: digital design can become physical reality in minutes."**

**[Hand token to guest]**

**"Take a picture with it if you want—makes a great social media post!"**

## 💬 KEY TALKING POINTS (If Asked Questions)

### "How does the laser know where to cut?"
**"The computer calculates exact coordinates for every point on the design. It's like connect-the-dots, but with a laser beam. The G-code file has thousands of these coordinates."**

### "Is this used in real industries?"
**"Absolutely. Laser cutters are used to make phone cases, jewelry, signage, prototypes for cars and planes. Any company that makes products uses lasers. SpaceX, Boeing, you name it."**

### "Could you cut something else?"
**"Yep! Laser cutters can cut wood, leather, paper, fabric, rubber—basically anything organic. They can't cut metal (we'd need different equipment for that). We stick with acrylic because it's safe and looks good."**

### "Why not just 3D print it?"
**"3D printing is slower and more expensive for this type of part. A laser cutter is faster for flat designs. If we needed a 3D object (like a robot head), we'd 3D print it."**

### "What's that smell?"
**"That's the acrylic burning—it's totally normal and harmless. The ventilation system carries it outside. That's why we always run the fan."**

### "Can I try cutting something?"
**"Not today, because this is a demo event and we don't have time to train everyone on the laser cutter. But in our full program, you'd get hands-on training and earn your laser cutter certification!"**

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Problem: Laser Won't Start
**Solution:**
- [ ] Check if safety enclosure door is closed (won't fire if door is open)
- [ ] Check if emergency stop button is in correct position
- [ ] Verify G-code file is loaded on screen
- [ ] If still no go, **call Lead Technician immediately**
- **Say to guests:** "We're having a small technical issue. Let me show you a pre-cut token while we get this sorted..."

### Problem: Laser Cuts Unevenly or Incompletely
**Solution:**
- [ ] **DO NOT RUN AGAIN** (could cause fire or damage)
- [ ] Check focal length (distance from laser to material)
- [ ] Check if material was placed correctly in cutting bed
- [ ] Reset laser head to home position
- [ ] Verify G-code file is correct
- [ ] Try again on fresh acrylic blank
- **If issue persists:** Call Lead Technician

### Problem: Fire or Smoke
**Solution (PRIORITY 1):**
- [ ] **PRESS EMERGENCY STOP** (red button, usually top-left of machine)
- [ ] If fire is inside enclosure, **DO NOT OPEN DOOR** yet—let ventilation fan cool it
- [ ] If fire persists >10 seconds, grab fire extinguisher and spray into enclosure
- [ ] Evacuate guests from zone immediately
- [ ] Call fire department (911)
- **Tell everyone:** "Everyone back! Fire safety is our top priority!"

### Problem: Material Not Feeding into Cutter Properly
**Solution:**
- [ ] Stop the cutter immediately (press stop button)
- [ ] Check if material is aligned in the cutting bed
- [ ] Remove and reposition material
- [ ] Re-load the G-code file
- [ ] Try again

### Problem: Too Many Guests Waiting
**Solution:**
- [ ] Pause the laser and set a timer for next 15 minutes
- [ ] Tell waiting guests: "Thanks for your patience! We'll be ready for the next group in 10 minutes"
- [ ] If line is very long, offer a "quick view" (30-sec explanation of machine, no full demo)
- [ ] Tell them to visit Zone 1 or Zone 3 and come back

### Problem: Guest Asks to Go Closer or Touch the Laser
**Solution:**
- [ ] Politely but firmly: "I appreciate your interest, but for safety, we need to stay at least 3 feet back"
- [ ] Explain: "The laser is super hot, and the beam can damage eyes. We're being careful to keep everyone safe"
- [ ] Redirect: "But check out this token—this is what the laser just cut!"
