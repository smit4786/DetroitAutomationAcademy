### **ZONE 2: RAPID PROTOTYPING (LASER CUTTING)**
**"The Body - Watch Your Design Come to Life"**

#### Station Overview
- **Duration per group:** 12-18 minutes
- **Capacity:** 6-8 guests per group
- **Key Learning:** Digital design → rapid physical prototyping using laser cutting
- **Primary Equipment:** Laser cutter, acrylic blanks, G-code files, ventilation system
- **Safety Level:** HIGH - Must follow all procedures exactly

#### Pre-Demo Safety Briefing (MANDATORY - Every Guest Group)
**Gather at safe distance (minimum 3 feet from laser) before demo begins**

**Script:**
> "Okay, we're about to fire up the laser cutter. This is cool, but we need to follow safety rules:
> 
> 1. NO ONE gets closer than 3 feet from the machine while running
> 2. Don't put your hands in the cutting bed
> 3. Don't look directly at the laser beam
> 4. If fire alarm goes off, we evacuate immediately
> 5. Fire extinguisher is here [point] in case of emergency
> 
> Everyone understand? Great. Let's do this."

#### Core Demonstration Flow

1. **Opening & Concept** (60 sec)
   - Gesture to laser cutter
   - Script: "This is a laser cutter—a robot with a laser for a finger. In 30 seconds, it cuts your commemorative token from acrylic."
   - Explain connection: "In Zone 1, someone designed this token with Python. Now we're bringing that digital design into reality."
   - Introduce concept: "That's called rapid prototyping—idea to physical product in minutes, not weeks."

2. **Show The Design on Screen** (90 sec)
   - Point to laptop connected to laser cutter
   - Explain G-code: "These are coordinates telling the laser exactly where to cut"
   - Show token outline on screen
   - Point out design elements: "Detroit Automation Academy" on one side, date on other
   - Show multiple design options if available: gears, squares, circles, triangles

3. **Material & Safety Verification** (60 sec)
   - Point to acrylic blank in cutting bed
   - Explain material choice:
     - Safe (no toxic fumes)
     - Durable (won't break)
     - Looks nice (smooth laser edges)
   - Verify pre-cut checklist:
     - Laser is focused ✓
     - Ventilation fan running ✓
     - Safety enclosure door closed ✓
   - **Key message:** "If anything is off, we don't run the laser. Safety first, always."

4. **Fire Up The Laser!** (30 sec setup)
   - Narrate each step:
     - "Moving laser to starting position..."
     - "Loading G-code file for token..."
     - "And... here we go!"
   - Press 'Run' or 'Cut' button

5. **Watch The Cutting Process** (20-40 sec)
   - Narrate continuously:
     - "See the laser tracing the design? That's a CO2 laser—5,000 degrees Celsius"
     - "Focused into a beam the width of a human hair"
     - "The laser vaporizes the acrylic as it cuts"
     - "That smell? Acrylic burning—totally normal. Ventilation fan carries it outside"
     - "Notice the speed? 30 seconds total. In a factory, this takes hours of manual work."
   - When finished: "And... done! Token is cut. It's still hot—we'll let it cool 30 seconds."

6. **Remove & Present Token** (60 sec)
   - Wait for cooling period
   - Carefully remove token using tongs or heat-resistant gloves
   - Script: "Here's your token! Feel the edge—smooth, right? That's precision laser work. No rough edges like traditional cutting."
   - Pass token to guest
   - Explain significance: "This token proves you participated. It's also a reminder: digital design becomes physical reality in minutes."
   - Encourage: "Take a picture with it—great for social media!"

7. **Closing Transition** (30 sec)
   - Direct to Zone 3: "Next up: autonomous robots that navigate on their own"

#### Key Talking Points
- **How does laser know where to cut?** Computer calculates exact coordinates; G-code has thousands
- **Used in real industries?** SpaceX, Boeing, phone case makers, jewelry makers
- **What else can you cut?** Wood, leather, paper, fabric—not metal (need different equipment)
- **Why not 3D print?** 3D printing is slower and more expensive for flat designs
- **That smell?** Acrylic burning (normal and harmless); ventilation handles it

#### Safety Procedures (CRITICAL)

**Before Every Laser Run:**
- [ ] Safety enclosure door is fully closed
- [ ] Emergency stop button in correct position
- [ ] Laser focal distance verified
- [ ] Ventilation fan confirmed running
- [ ] Acrylic blank properly positioned
- [ ] All guests standing at least 3 feet back

**If Laser Doesn't Start:**
- Check door is closed (won't fire if open)
- Check emergency stop button position
- Verify G-code file is loaded
- If still no go: **Call Lead Technician immediately**
- Say to guests: "Small technical issue. Here's a pre-cut token while we sort this..."

**If Cutting Is Uneven/Incomplete:**
- **DO NOT RUN AGAIN** (fire/damage risk)
- Check focal length
- Check material placement in bed
- Reset laser to home position
- Try again on fresh acrylic blank
- If persists: **Call Lead Technician**

#### Troubleshooting Quick Reference
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Laser won't start | Check door, E-stop, G-code loaded |
| Uneven cutting | Check focal length; verify material placement |
| Ventilation off | Turn on immediately before cutting |
| Guest too close | Politely redirect: "Safety first—let's step back here" |
| Token stuck in bed | Use tongs; don't force |

#### Photo Opportunities

### **ZONE 3: AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS (ROBOTICS & SENSOR FUSION)**
**"The Brain - The Future of Robotics"**

#### Station Overview
- **Duration per group:** 15-20 minutes
- **Capacity:** 6-8 guests standing around demo area
- **Key Learning:** Robotics, sensor fusion, autonomous navigation principles used in self-driving cars
- **Primary Equipment:** Rover 1 (primary), Rover 2 (backup), laptops with SSH, boundary markers, obstacle props
- **Advanced Concept:** Sensor fusion and collision avoidance

#### Core Demonstration Flow

1. **Opening & Rover Introduction** (90 sec)
   - Gesture to rovers in marked demo area
   - Script: "Welcome to Zone 3! These are rovers—autonomous robots. Unlike remote-controlled cars, these think for themselves."
   - Explain key difference: "They use sensors to 'see' obstacles and Python code to make decisions"
   - Example: "Tell rover 'go north 100 steps, avoid obstacles,' and it does it on its own—no remote!"
   - Connection to real world: "Same principles power self-driving cars and Boston Dynamics robots"

2. **Introduce The Rover's Parts** (90 sec)
   - Pick up Rover 1 and hold it up
   - Point to each component:
     - **Wheels:** Two motors control movement (forward, backward, left, right)
     - **Ultrasonic Sensor:** "Eyes" of the rover—sends sound waves, listens for echoes, detects obstacles
     - **Raspberry Pi:** Tiny computer (credit card size) runs Python code for navigation
     - **Battery:** Powers everything
   - Script: "I can control this rover using SSH—a way to connect from my laptop to the computer inside. I send Python commands and the rover responds."

3. **Demonstrate Manual Movement** (60 sec)
   - Set rover on floor within 10' x 10' marked boundary
   - Script: "First, manual movement. I'll use Python to move the rover north 50 steps."
   - Type/show command: `rover.move_north(50)`
   - Script: "That command moved the rover 50 units north. Other directions: east, west, south. We can chain commands to make complex paths."
   - Demonstrate 2-3 additional commands: turn, stop
   - Script: "That's code-based movement. Let's make it intelligent."

4. **Obstacle Detection Demo** (90 sec)
   - Place obstacle (cardboard box) in rover's path
   - Script: "Now it gets intelligent. I'll tell rover 'move north, but if you detect an obstacle within 6 inches, STOP.'"
   - Execute: `rover.navigate_with_collision_avoidance(direction='north', max_distance=200)`
   - Narrate as rover approaches:
     - "Moving... moving..."
     - "Distance 20 inches... 12 inches... 8 inches... 6 inches—STOP!"
   - Script: "The rover detected the obstacle and stopped automatically—no crash, no remote control. The sensor and code worked together."
   - Define: "That's 'sensor fusion'—combining data from multiple sensors to make smart decisions. Self-driving cars do this with cameras, radar, and LIDAR."

5. **Autonomous Navigation (Full Course)** (90 sec - if time and rovers in good condition)
   - Set up boundary or show course on screen
   - Script: "Grand finale: full autonomous navigation. The rover will complete a whole course with no obstacles."
   - Show command sequence:
   ```python
   rover.navigate(
       path=[(north, 100), (east, 100), (south, 100), (west, 100)],
       collision_avoidance=True,
       speed=medium
   )
   ```
   - Script: "Go north 100, then east 100, then south 100, then west 100. If hit obstacle, stop and alert me. Let's run it!"
   - Narrate as rover completes course
   - When finished: "And... back to the start! Autonomous navigation complete."
   - Real-world connections:
     - Self-driving cars navigate city blocks
     - Warehouse robots navigate crowded spaces
     - Mars rovers navigate terrain (signals take 20 minutes!)

6. **Sensor Fusion Explained** (60 sec)
   - Show sensor readings on laptop screen if available
   - Script: "Sensor fusion = Combine data from multiple sensors to make better decisions"
   - In this rover:
     - **Ultrasonic sensor** → Distance to obstacles
     - **Motor encoders** → How far we've moved
     - **Compass** → Direction heading
     - **Clock** → Timing
   - Script: "Raspberry Pi combines ALL this data to answer: 'Where am I?' 'Is there obstacle?' 'Should I adjust path?'"
   - Scale-up: "Self-driving car uses cameras, radar, LIDAR, GPS, inertial sensors—dozens working together to keep you safe"

7. **Closing Transition** (30 sec)
   - Celebrate learning: "You just learned robotics principles used by Tesla, NASA, Boston Dynamics"
   - Direct back to entrance: "Grab your token and your commemorative interest form"

#### Key Talking Points
- **How fast can it go?** Set to medium for safety; can go faster; industrial robots go much faster
- **What if battery dies?** Rover stops. Real robots auto-dock at charging stations
- **Multiple obstacles?** Yes, with advanced sensors and code; warehouse robots handle thousands
- **How do self-driving cars use this?** Same principles but way more complex (cameras, radar, ultrasonic, GPS, AI)
- **Can we program it differently?** Absolutely! In full program, students would create custom paths
